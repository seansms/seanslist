Sean's List runs on Python 3.7
and WxPython 4.x

Get WxPython: 
pip install -U wxPython


Start Sean's List in the same folder as the seanslist0.py file.
In windows:
py seanslist0.py

Prepare my_list.txt
Each column in SeansList is represented by two comma separated lists.
The first list represents the combo box options.
The second list represents values in the list control below.  Each 
list will work with or without a trailing comma, but will be subsequently
afforded with a trailing comma.  To represent an empty list, use a single comma (,).

blank_lists.txt is provided if you want all blanks as a start.  Simply copy the file to
my_lists.txt before you start.

SeansList 0_4 supports four lists, so your my_list.txt should have eight lines with
at least one comma (,) on each line.

After each new entry to a list, all lists are saved to my_list.txt and two backups
are made my_list2.txt and my_list3.txt.  I recommend installing Sean's List in a folder
that is copied to the cloud for a backup and to be reached from other locations.
